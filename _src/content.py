body="""
<p>Before anyone talks about selling, the house just needs to be looked after. Here's what helps most in the first few weeks.</p>
<ol class="steps">
<li><b>Keep it secure.</b> Lock the doors and windows, and have someone stop by at least once a week.</li>
<li><b>Take photos before anything changes.</b> Photograph every room, inside and out, before any cleaning or repairs. It gives the estate and the whole family a clear record of the home's condition.</li>
<li><b>Call the homeowner's insurance company.</b> Let them know the owner has passed and the home may be empty. Many policies limit coverage when a home sits vacant, so ask what you need to do to stay covered.</li>
<li><b>Keep the utilities on.</b> Power, water, and heat protect the house from damage and make it easier to show later.</li>
<li><b>Keep up with the bills.</b> The mortgage, property taxes, insurance, and HOA dues don't pause. Keep every receipt, and ask the attorney how those payments will be handled.</li>
<li><b>Hold off on the belongings.</b> It's natural to want to start sorting. Wait on selling or giving away anything of value until someone has the legal authority to do it.</li>
<li><b>Gather the paperwork.</b> Look for the will or trust, the deed, recent mortgage, HELOC, and property tax statements, the insurance policy, and any HOA information. Order several certified copies of the death certificate.</li>
<li><b>Talk to an attorney before signing anything.</b> That includes offers from investors who reach out by mail or phone. There's no rush to respond.</li>
</ol>
<p class="why">And here's why it matters: a well-cared-for house protects the value of the estate for everyone in the family.</p>

<h2>How to find out how the home was owned</h2>

<h2>Two assumptions to double-check</h2>
<ul class="dots">
<li><b>"There's a will, so there's no probate."</b> A will says who inherits. If the house was in the person's name alone, it may still go through probate.</li>
<li><b>"There's a trust, so the house is in it."</b> Not always. Homes are sometimes never transferred into the trust, or are taken out during a refinance. The deed will tell you.</li>

body="""
<h2>When does a sale need court confirmation?</h2>
<p>It depends on the authority in the Personal Representative's Letters. With limited authority, the sale goes to court. With full authority, a sale only goes to court if an heir objects to the Notice of Proposed Action.</p>
<p>For a court-confirmed sale, the price usually has to be at least 90% of the value set by the <b>probate referee</b>, a court-appointed appraiser.</p>

<h2>What happens at the hearing</h2>
<p>Any qualified buyer can make a higher offer at the hearing. The highest bid wins, and the court confirms the sale.</p>
<h2>What this means for your family</h2>
<p>A court-confirmed sale adds a hearing date and a bidding step to the timeline. Hearing dates depend on the county court's calendar, so it helps to plan for it from the start.</p>

<h2>How stepped-up basis works</h2>
<div class="box"><p>Say your parents bought their home in 1985 for $150,000, and it was worth $1,100,000 when your mother passed. If the family sells a few months later for $1,120,000, capital gains are usually figured from about $1,100,000, not $150,000.</p></div>
<p>That's why selling soon after inheriting often means little or no capital gains tax. Holding the house for years while it gains value is a different story, so it's worth a conversation with the estate's CPA before deciding.</p>
<h2>Good questions to ask your CPA</h2>
<ul class="dots">
<li>Should we get a date-of-death value for the home in writing?</li>
